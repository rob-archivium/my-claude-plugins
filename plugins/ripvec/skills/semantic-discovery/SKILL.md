description: "Use when searching for code by concept or behavior rather than exact text. Triggers on: 'find the code that handles X', 'where is Y implemented', 'how does Z work', 'find functions related to', 'search for the retry logic', 'where do we handle errors', 'find the authentication flow'. Use instead of Grep when the user describes WHAT the code does rather than WHAT it says."

# Semantic Code Discovery

When someone asks "find the code that handles database connection pooling" — they don't mean grep for "connection pooling". They mean: find the actual implementation, wherever it lives, whatever it's called.

## The decision: Grep vs search_code

| User says | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "Find `TODO` comments" | Grep | Exact text match |
| "Find the retry logic" | search_code | Conceptual — code may use `backoff`, `attempt`, `loop` |
| "Find `useAuth` hook" | Grep | Known symbol name |
| "Find authentication handling" | search_code | Could be middleware, decorator, guard, hook |
| "Find `SELECT * FROM users`" | Grep | Exact SQL |
| "Find queries that join users and orders" | search_code | Semantic join pattern |

**Rule of thumb**: If the user describes BEHAVIOR, use search_code. If they name a SYMBOL, use Grep or LSP.

## How to search effectively

**Natural language queries work best:**
```
search_code("retry logic with exponential backoff")
search_code("WebSocket connection lifecycle management")
search_code("database migration rollback handling")
search_code("rate limiting middleware for API endpoints")
```

**Results include full source code** in fenced blocks with language annotation. Review the code directly — don't call `Read` on the same file unless you need more context.

**Chain with LSP for precision:**
1. `search_code("trait that all backends implement")` → finds `EmbedBackend` in `mod.rs`
2. LSP `findReferences` on `EmbedBackend` → shows all implementations
3. LSP `incomingCalls` on a specific method → shows callers

## Examples across languages

**Rust**: "Find where we handle the case when the GPU runs out of memory"
```
search_code("GPU out of memory error handling")
```
→ Finds the error variants and recovery paths, even if the code uses `crate::Error::Metal(...)` not "out of memory"

**TypeScript/React**: "Find components that do client-side form validation"
```
search_code("form validation with error messages")
```
→ Finds validation hooks, Zod schemas, form error state management

**Python/FastAPI**: "Find the endpoint that processes webhook callbacks"
```
search_code("webhook callback processing endpoint")
```
→ Finds the route handler regardless of whether it's called `webhook_handler`, `process_callback`, or `handle_event`

**Go**: "Find the goroutine that watches for config file changes"
```
search_code("file watcher goroutine config reload")
```
→ Finds the fsnotify watcher setup and reload handler

## Combining search with structure

When search_code returns results from many files:
1. Run `get_repo_map` to understand which files are central
2. Prioritize results from high-PageRank files (they're architecturally important)
3. Results from test files or example files are supporting context, not primary

## search_text vs search_code

- `search_code` — optimized for source code semantics
- `search_text` — optimized for documentation, READMEs, comments
- When unsure, try `search_code` first
